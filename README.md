Tired of having so many different note/test taking apps, websites where all the features I want aren't available or behind a restrictive system.

This app will expand greatly with time and my growing knowledge of website development.

PLANS:
- Add Ability to edit collection information
- Screen app for security, adding API authentication and encrypted/hashing relevant data
- Optimize code, narrowing down expensive workflows
- Finalize and beutify UI and maximize UX
- Deploy to AWS for Testing and Production
- Add admin panel and associated CRUD
- Combine edit collection and item APIs into one

FINISHED PLANS:
- Add Signout button
- Add page saving for main pages
- Get Collection, Collection Item, and Homepage workflows done as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Add Ability to delete collections
