Don't know yet LOL.

Tired of having so many different note/test taking apps, websites where all the features I want aren't available or behind a restrictive system.

This app will expand greatly with time and my growing knowledge of website development.

PLANS:
- Get Collection, Collection Item, and Homepage workflows done as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Screen app for security, adding API authentication and encrypted/hashing relevant data
- Finalize and beutify UI and maximize UX
- Add Signout button
- Add page saving for main pages
- Deploy to AWS for Testing and Production
